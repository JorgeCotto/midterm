            <p class="bio" style="text-align: justify">I am an artist, writer, musician and photographer. I have been an artist and musician since I was a child with formal training beginning at The High School of Art and Design. The mediums I primarily use are graphite, pen and ink and markers for illustration. Acrylic, gouache and watercolors are used for fine art. For the last 10 years or so, I have been freelancing as a graphic designer and illustrator. My biggest clients thus far have been The New York Post and New York Parks and Recreation. My work has been on exhibit in small shows around the city and I once had my work exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum.</p>

My works was published in The John Jay College Finest publication, which has been published every year for the last 20 years, or so. I worked as a journalist for The Banner,  the school newspaper at The College of Staten Island, and I have had poetry published in small publications around the New York City area.
